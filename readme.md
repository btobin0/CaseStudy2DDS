## Assignment

This assignment we were to investigate the possible reasons for attrition for a particulare company. The entire project was coded in R and the data file was in CSV format.
THe assignment wanted use of various graphing techniques and tests against the data to show that accuracy of the data.

## What was done

First the files were merged and the data was cleaned and filled where necessary.
Second the data was adjusted to be in a dataframe for viewing. 
The data was then tested aganst a Neural Network and later a other tests learned from taking this course.

## The Files


- [Main Data File](https://github.com/btobin0/case2/blob/master/AllData3.csv) - Main Data file for investigation. THe NoAttrition and NoSalary files were combined to this file.
- [Turn-in CSV File](https://github.com/btobin0/case2/blob/master/Case2PredictionsTobin%20Salary.csv) - This is the same file as the AllData3.csv file but was not used for the assignment. This is for grading purposes only.
